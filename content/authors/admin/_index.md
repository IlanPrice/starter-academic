I am an Applied Mathematics PhD Candidate at the University of Oxford and the Alan Turing Institute. My PhD research focusses on sparsity, low-dimensionality, and efficiency in deep learning. 

From May to October 2022 I will be joining DeepMind as a Research Scientist Intern, working on applying deep learning to weather/climate. I also did some work in this area in 2021 as a Research Intern with ClimateAI. 

Outside of this area I am broadly interested in interdisciplinary applications of Machine Learning for social good, and have a diverse background spanning different research areas, as well as leadership and organisational experience.
