I am a South African Research Scientist at Google DeepMind. I am also finishing up my DPhil in Mathematics at the University of Oxford and the Alan Turing Institute. 

My DPhil research has focused on sparsity and efficiency in deep learning, and I have also spent some time working on deep learning for weather forecasting. Beyond these topics I have a broad set of research areas I think are exciting and important - from AI4science to new model architectures to factuality and attribution in LLMs to applications of Machine Learning for social good.  

I have a relatively diverse and interdisciplinary background which includes substantial leadership and organisational experience. Prior to the DPhil, I completed an MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing at Oxford, and received my undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics and Philosophy from the University of Cape Town. Along the way I have also done a few non-research related things like running a social justice oriented youth organization in SA.
